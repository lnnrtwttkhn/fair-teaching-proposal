### Short Project Description

### Project Goals

> In addition to imparting subject-related knowledge, virtual exchange among students and researchers from the partner university must be the primary goal.

- learn about version control
- increase digital and dat a literacy in students
- foster exchange among students and researchers from the partner university

### Partner University

> Explain your selection of partner university/universities. If the selected university is not a strategic or profile partner, separately explain the importance of the partnership.

The Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) is one of the profile partner universities of the Universität Hamburg (UHH).
The student target group of the proposed course come from diverse study programs, including psychology, marketing, neuro-marketing and medicine.
The EUR is at the forefront of the Open Science movement, promoting transparency, collaboration, and responsible research practices.
For example, in August 2023, EUR hosted the Netherlands's National Open Science Festival with 400 visitors.
Git and GitHub are tools that allow students and researchers to put principles of open science into practice, and is in high demand in EUR's research community.
Dr. Martinovici is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Rotterdam School of Management at the Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Beyond implementing principles of open and reproducible science in her own research, she has taught several workshops on version control with Git and GitHub, for example at the renowned conference of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS).
Together, Dr. Martinovici and the Erasmus University Rotterdam are ideal partners for the proposed project as part of the ILLF@home program.

### Contributions

> What content-related or financial contribution will the partner make?

Given Dr. Martinovici's extensive experience in teaching version control with Git and GitHub, she will contribute to the content-related development of the course materials.
Her expertise will allow to fill current gaps in the course materials and to adapt the course to the needs of students from the Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Specifically, content-related contributions may include topics such as version control of large datasets, automation with Makefiles, and data protection and privcacy.
Financial contributions by the partner university are planned for the future once the course is established and could, for example, be supported by teaching assistants from the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

### Intercultural experience

> How will you help students gain intercultural experience in addition to subject-specific knowledge through the courses on offer?

Fundamentally, Git and GitHub are not ony tools for version control but also critical for effective collaboration on digital objects.
While they are domain-agnostic, we will use examples that aim at stimulating intercultural exchange between students and researchers from the partner universities.
For example, as part of the course exercises students will be asked to contribute to a repository that is hosted on GitHub and that is used by students from both universities.
This will allow students to learn about version control and collaboration while also interacting with students from the partner university.
In doing so, students might exchange about their field of study, student life in their respective cities, or other topics of mutual interest that allow them to gain intercultural experience.

### Embedding in the curriculum

> The ILLF@home program aims to establish international virtual learning and teaching formats for the long term. To what degree is the project embedded in the curriculum and how do you plan on ensuring the project being applied for will become a long-term aspect of the curriculum?

At Universität Hamburg, the course has taken place for the first time as an in-person seminar during the winter term 2023/24 as part of the elective module of the master's program in psychology.
The course is planned to be embedded regularly in the curriculum and offered each winter term.
An additional offering of the course as part of the PhD graduate school of the Institute of Psychology is currently being discussed.
Both course formats could regularly be offered international virtual learning and teaching formats for the long term.
Similarly on the side of the Erausmus University Rotterdam, the course could be offered regularly as part of the master's program in marketing and the PhD graduate school of the Rotterdam School of Management.
The ILLF@home program will provide the necessary support to establish an international virtual learning and teaching format that can be embedded regularly in the curricula of both partner universities.
