### Short Project Description

In an international and virtual course with collaborative hands-on exercises, students from Universit채t Hamburg and Erasmus University Rotterdam will learn "Version Control of Code and Data with Git."
Version control is as a fundamental tool for managing digital content, with Git standing out as one of the most widely recognized version control systems.
Its importance goes beyond general use, proving valuable in academia by offering an organized and systematic approach to tracking and managing changes in scholarly work.
Git and GitHub provide precise documentation of changes, support revision and comparison of versions, allow simultaneous collaboration on files, and facilitate effective collaboration through transparent sharing, viewing, and collaborative development of code and data.
The course will be based on existing learning materials of a course, previously supported by the Digital & Data Literacy in Teaching Lab program and currently taught as an in-person seminar at Universit채t Hamburg.
With the support of the ILLF@home program, the course will be adapted for an international and virtual learning environment.

### Project Goals

> In addition to imparting subject-related knowledge, virtual exchange among students and researchers from the partner university must be the primary goal.

This course aims to teach students the fundamentals of version control using Git, with a focus on precise documentation of changes in digital objects, collaborative work, and effective use of platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
It integrates practical exercises to enhance skills in code and data management, aligning with the broader goals of promoting transparency, accessibility, and verifiability of knowledge in science and society.
Additionally, the course covers theoretical concepts in open science and reproducibility fostering a reflective engagement with digital and data-driven processes and enhancing students' employability in research, data analysis, and other sectors requiring digital competences.

Beyond these subject-related goals, the course aims to foster virtual exchange among students and researchers from the two partner universities
Through collaborative learning and practical exercises, students engage in shared projects, encouraging active participation and the exchange of diverse perspectives.
Using online platforms like GitHub or GitLab for collaborative development not only facilitates real-time interactions but also provides a space for continuous communication.
Virtual discussions, joint problem-solving sessions, and collaborative coding exercises allow students to learn from each other's experiences, practices, and cultural backgrounds.
This international teaching collaboration, therefore, not only enhances technical proficiency in version control using Git but also promotes a rich exchange of ideas among students and researchers from the partner universities.

### Partner University

> Explain your selection of partner university/universities. If the selected university is not a strategic or profile partner, separately explain the importance of the partnership.

The Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) is one of the profile partner universities of the Universit채t Hamburg (UHH).
The student target group of the proposed course come from diverse study programs, including psychology, marketing, neuro-marketing and medicine.
The EUR is at the forefront of the Open Science movement, promoting transparency, collaboration, and responsible research practices.
For example, in August 2023, EUR hosted the Netherlands's National Open Science Festival, attracting 400 visitors.
Git and GitHub are tools that allow students and researchers to put principles of open science into practice, and they are in high demand within EUR's research and student community.
Dr. Martinovici is an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Rotterdam School of Management at the Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Beyond implementing principles of open and reproducible science in her own research, she has taught several workshops on version control with Git and GitHub, for example at the renowned conference of the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS).
Together, Dr. Martinovici and Erasmus University Rotterdam present an ideal partnership for the proposed project under the ILLF@home program.

### Contributions

> What content-related or financial contribution will the partner make?

Given Dr. Martinovici's extensive experience in teaching version control with Git and GitHub, she will contribute to the content-related development of the course materials.
Her expertise will allow to fill current gaps in the course materials and to adapt the course to the needs of students from the Erasmus University Rotterdam.
Specifically, content-related contributions may include topics such as version control of large datasets, automation with Makefiles, and data protection and privacy.
Financial contributions by the partner university are planned for the future once the course is established and could, for example, be supported by teaching assistants from the Erasmus University Rotterdam.

### Intercultural experience

> How will you help students gain intercultural experience in addition to subject-specific knowledge through the courses on offer?

Fundamentally, Git and GitHub are not only tools for version control but also critical for effective collaboration on digital objects.
While they are domain-agnostic, we will use examples that aim at stimulating intercultural exchange between students and researchers from the partner universities.
For example, as part of the course exercises students will be asked to contribute to a repository that is hosted on GitHub and that is used by students from both universities.
This will allow students to learn about version control and collaboration while also interacting with students from the partner university.
In doing so, students might exchange information about their field of study, student life in their respective cities, or other topics of mutual interest that allow them to gain intercultural experience.

### Embedding in the curriculum

> The ILLF@home program aims to establish international virtual learning and teaching formats for the long term. To what degree is the project embedded in the curriculum and how do you plan on ensuring the project being applied for will become a long-term aspect of the curriculum?

At Universit채t Hamburg, the course has taken place for the first time as an in-person seminar during the winter term 2023/24 as part of the elective module of the master's program in psychology.
The course is planned to be embedded regularly in the curriculum and offered each winter term.
An additional offering of the course as part of the PhD graduate school of the Institute of Psychology is currently being discussed.
Both course formats could regularly be offered international virtual learning and teaching formats for the long term.
Similarly on the side of the Erausmus University Rotterdam, the course could be offered to ERIM PhD students. 
ERIM (Erasmus Research Institute of Management) is a joint research institute of Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University (RSM) and the Erasmus School of Economics (ESE).
Via the Open Science Community Rotterdam the course will also be promoted to PhD students at other EUR research institutes, thus reaching a diverse set of research fields including psychology and medicine.
The ILLF@home program will provide the necessary support to establish an international virtual learning and teaching format that can be embedded regularly in the curricula of both partner universities.
