# Project Description

## Course Content

The digital objects on our computers are in constant flux.
Manuscripts, programming code, and research data undergo continuous and often collaborative changes over extended periods of time.
The systematic documentation of these changes forms the basis for controlled and reproducible work on digital objects.

In a seminar with practical exercises, students learn "Version Control of Code and Data with Git."
Version control is the notebook for a digital world, and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is perhaps the most well-known version control system.
It enables precise documentation of changes in digital objects, allowing one to trace who changed what, when, how, and why in a file.
Changes can be revised, versions can be compared, and restoration is possible.
Moreover, Git allows simultaneous work on the same file, with parallel versions systematically integrated.
Git also facilitates effective collaboration, as platforms like GitHub or GitLab enable sharing, transparent viewing, utilization, and collaborative development of code and data with the world.
Thus, version control contributes to making knowledge generated from data transparent, accessible, and verifiable.
As an effective method for storing and processing code and data, version control represents a core competency of Data Literacy.

In their studies, students in many research domains receive a multifaceted education in research methodology, statistics, and scientific work.
The current teaching concept complements practical skills in the effective management of programming code and research data.
The acquired skills are particularly applicable in empirical dissertation projects.
Discussing concepts such as reproducibility, open code, and open data supports understanding of principles of good scientific practice.
Due to their extensive methodological training, students are in demand not only for research but also for careers as data analysts or data scientists in the business sector.
Since version control is a standard in professional software development, the employability and innovation capacity of graduates are enhanced.

In addition to these practical competencies, students are taught theoretical concepts in the areas of open science, open code, open data, and open source.
This enables a reflective engagement with increasingly digital and data-driven economic and societal processes, promoting participatory self-empowered citizenship.

The continuation of the teaching concept at the University of Hamburg, especially in a newly established research-oriented master's program and a graduate school for doctora students, is anticipated.
Skills in version control are relevant in all fields where digital data is processed.
The teaching content and practical exercises are also cross-disciplinary and transferable to other study programs.
The publication of all teaching materials as Open Educational Resources allows independent reuse and development (see [teaching concept](#teaching-concept)).

## Teaching Concept

The didactic teaching concept consists of a seminar (2 teaching hours per week) with lectures by the instructors (20%) and practical collaborative hands-on exercises (80%).
The lectures provide theoretical foundations (e.g., reproducibility, open code, open data) and transition into interactive demonstrations of Git ("code-along").
These teaching formats are complemented by supervised exercises in small groups or paris, which may continue outside class time.
The courses are accompanied by continuous evaluation and self-assessment quiz questions, implemented in [formR](https://formr.org/) and supervised by a student assistant.
Evaluation data and quiz responses are stored anonymously and reused within the course as exemplary datasets.
All software tools used are open-source, freely available, compatible with all operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows), and mostly provided by the University of Hamburg and the partner university, Erasmus University Rotterdam.

As Git is primarily developed for command-line usage, the teaching concept also focuses on interaction with the command line.
The command line is a part of a computer program that takes a text line as input and interprets it as a command in context.
In the initial teaching units, basic command line commands are demonstrated and practiced in joint exercises.
Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are also available as an alternative to the command line.
GitKraken or GitHub Desktop are used as the GUIs for Git, available in a free Pro version for students through the GitHub Student Developer Pack.
Digital technologies such as Jupyter Notebooks and Quarto are primarily used for creating teaching materials (project website, presentations, practical exercises).
To prevent potential issues with software installation, Jupyter Notebooks allow interaction within prepared computational environments provided through Jupyter-Hub at the University of Hamburg or Binder, accessible through a web browser.

All teaching materials are published as Open Educational Resources, including the project website, under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.
Discoverability and citability of teaching materials are ensured through persistent identifiers on the Zenodo platform.
The courses are conducted in an online teaching-learning setting using Zoom.
Technical issues can be addressed simultaneously in "Breakout-Rooms" through Zoom with the help of the tutors.
Communication outside the classes can take place through the GitHub platform.
Basic programming skills are advantageous for the course but are not mandatory.
The introduction to all used software technologies is part of the course.
The applicants have extensive experience in using all mentioned software tools in research and teaching.
