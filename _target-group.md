## Target group

There are two main target groups of the proposed project: research staff and students.

One main target group of the project are research staff at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Hamburg who are involved in teaching.
Our project aims to develop and pilot a new approach to the development of teaching materials.
As described in the [implementation plan](#implementation-plan), we plan to involve research staff in the following way:
First, we will offer workshops on how to create FAIR and reproducible teaching materials using Quarto and Git.
Second, we will support teaching research staff in the implementation of the proposed approach in their teaching.
Third, we will conduct surveys and structured interviews with research staff to evaluate our novel teaching approach and identify potential pitfalls and further opportunities for improvement.

The second main target group are MSc and PhD students at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Hamburg.
In particular, the Master of Science in Psychology is a new consecutive program that is international and strongly research-oriented.
Extensive methodological and statistical skills are taught in required modules.
The degree program places special emphasis on methods, which are taught in depth in complementary basic research modules, applied modules, a project seminar, and a thesis module.

Implementing open and FAIR teaching development will give students the opportunity to participate in the development of their own teaching materials.
While students can view and directly contribute to the teaching materials as they are developed, they can also participate in the development of educational resources by contributing feedback on the course contents, for example by sharing ideas or reporting issues through a dedicated feedback system that is integrated with the course contents.
For example, in a previous course a student reported a problem with an online quiz that was used to assess course participant's knowledge about the learning materials (see [here](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-survey/issues/28)).
The course instructors could then respond to the issue directly and link it to the update in the course materials that solve the issue.
This provides transparency to the student who can see when and how the issue was resolved but also allows future users of the materials to establish provenance and understand why a certain change in the course materials was implemented.
This enables them to reflect on increasingly digital and data-driven economic and societal processes and thus promotes participatory "self-empowered citizenship".

As described in the [implementation plan](#implementation-plan), we will pilot the introduction of FAIR and reproducible teaching methods, in courses that focus on teaching digital research skills that will be offered to MSc and PhD students at the Institute of Psychology.
We will evaluate the impact of our proposed approach from a student approach that will complement the feedback from the teachers (see above) and help us to further refine the proposed teaching approach.
