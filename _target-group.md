## Target group

There are two main target groups of the proposed project: research staff and students.

The first main target group of the project are research staff at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Hamburg who are involved in teaching.
Our project aims to develop and pilot a new approach to the development of teaching materials.
As described in the [implementation plan](#implementation-plan), the involvement of research staff is planned in the following steps. 

The second main target group are MSc and PhD students at the Institute of Psychology at the University of Hamburg.
In particular, the Master of Science in Psychology is a consecutive program that is strongly research-oriented.
Extensive methodological and statistical skills are taught in required modules.
The degree program places special emphasis on methods, which are taught in depth in complementary basic research modules, applied modules, a project seminar, and a thesis module.

Implementing open and FAIR teaching development will give students the opportunity to participate in the development of their own teaching materials.
While students can view and directly contribute to the teaching materials as they are developed, they can also participate in the development of educational resources by contributing feedback on the course contents, for example by reporting ideas or issues through a dedicated feedback system that is integrated with the course contents.
For example, in a previous course a student reported a problem with an online quiz that was used to assess course participant's knowledge about the learning materials (see [here](https://github.com/lnnrtwttkhn/version-control-survey/issues/28)).
The course instructors could then respond to the issue directly and link it to the update in the course materials that solve the issue.
This provides transparency to the student who can see when and how the issue was resolved but also allows future users of the materials to establish provenance and understand why a certain change in the course materials was implemented.

As described in the [implementation plan](#implementation-plan), we will pilot the introduction of FAIR and reproducible teaching methods, in courses that focus on teaching digital research skills that will be offered to MSc and PhD students at the Institute of Psychology.
During their studies, Psychology students receive a multifaceted education in research methodology, statistics and scientific practices.
The teaching concept complements practice-oriented skills in the effective handling of programming code and research data.
The skills learned are applied in particular in the context of empirical theses and experimental psychology internships.
The discussion of concepts such as reproducibility, open code and open data supports the understanding of science and the principles of good scientific practice.
Due to their extensive methodological training, psychologists are also in demand for careers as data analysts or data scientists in business, in addition to professional activities in research.
Since version control is standard in professional software development, the employability and innovative ability of graduates is increased.
In addition to these practical skills, students are taught theoretical concepts in the areas of open science, open code, open data and open source.
This enables them to reflect on increasingly digital and data-driven economic and societal processes and thus promotes participatory "self-empowered citizenship".
